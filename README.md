# RouteCrafter

RouteCrafter is a web application designed to help users generate custom routes for walking, cycling, or driving. Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and powered by the Mapbox API, RouteCrafter allows users to specify the distance they want to travel (in miles or kilometers) and their preferred mode of transportation. The app then generates a closed-loop route, making it perfect for those who want to explore new areas or plan their workouts.
